# Lunch Time Slot Machine

This project is wired up to an Airtable database. If you want to build this for yourself, you'll to set up one for yourself and to get the airtable keys.

## Install
1. Pull down this bad boy
1. `yarn` to install the dependencies
1. Add a `.env` with your airtable keys: `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`, `AIRTABLE_BASE`, `AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME`
1. `yarn run dev` to start it up and play some lunch time slots

If you want to try the slots without running the project, you can take a look at the slightly outdated [CodePen](https://codepen.io/davidleininger/pen/GRymNKY) to see how it was built.
